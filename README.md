# Terrafrom VPC with private and public configuration

## How to use

Create a `env/default.tfvars` file by adding the variables needed that you can find in the [vars.tf](vars.tf).

Use the [makefile](Makefile) in order to `init` the project by installing the providers and set it up. Also you can `plan`, `apply` and `destroy` the resources.
